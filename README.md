# Fluorescence Tutorials

This repository contains tutorials for how to analyze fluorescence data, including example materials.
These tutorials were first presented as part of the iGEM 2020 Summer Webinar Series.
 - **Quantifying fluorescence and cell count with plate readers:** This webinar begins with a general introduction to fluorescence and OD, including a comparison of plate readers and other types of instruments, factors affecting fluorescence, and how to pick colors based on excitation and emission spectra. The second block of the webinar focuses on calibration of measurements for fluorescence and OD, and on debugging such measurements. Finally, the session ends with a discussion of how to interpret and debug calibrated plate reader data.
 - **Quantifying fluorescence and cell phenotypes with flow cytometry**: This webinar begins with an introduction to flow cytometry, including how these instruments operate and the types of data that they produce. The second block of the webinar focuses on calibration of measurements for fluorescence and cell size, and on debugging such measurements. Finally, the session ends with a discussion of how to interpret and debug calibrated flow cytometry data.

Accompanying data and example analysis code is provided for both plate reader and flow cytometer.
- Plate reader analysis makes use of the [Excel Process Validator](https://github.com/TASBE/Excel_Process_Validator)
- Flow cytometry analysis is performed using [TASBE Flow Analysics](https://github.com/TASBE/TASBEFlowAnalytics)
